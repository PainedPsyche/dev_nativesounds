# dev_nativesounds

I made this tool since I needed to check out sound effects that can be played using natives.

Currently supported functions:
* [PlaySoundFrontend](https://runtime.fivem.net/doc/natives/?_0x67C540AA08E4A6F5)
* [PlaySound](https://runtime.fivem.net/doc/natives/?_0x7FF4944CC209192D)


## Usage:

To open the ui use `/nativesounds` command in chat or `nativesounds` command in client console (F8).
