# dev_nativesounds

I made this tool since I needed to check out sound effect that can be played using [PlaySoundFrontend](https://runtime.fivem.net/doc/natives/?_0x67C540AA08E4A6F5) function.

I might possibly expand on it to allow exploring sounds played with other functions in the future.

## Usage:

To open the ui use `/nativesounds` command in chat or `nativesounds` command in client console (F8).
